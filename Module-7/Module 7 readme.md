## Problem Statement and Approach

### Problem Statement:

Seismic data from various sources contain information about the physical properties of the Earthâ€™s interior. The challenge is to process and analyze this data to predict the core radius based on seismic velocities and other related properties.

### Approach to Solve the Problem:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Collect seismic data from multiple files in different formats (such as .bm).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Filter and process the data to retain essential features.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Compute derived features such as P-wave velocity (P_v) and S-wave velocity (S_v) based on seismic data.
4. **Model Training**: Use Random Forest and XGBoost for regression tasks to predict the core radius from seismic features.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using cross-validation and performance metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) and percentage error.

## Functionality and Workflow

### Step 1: Preparing the Dataset

**Function**: preprocess_data(file_paths)
**Process**:

- Load seismic data files using glob and pandas.
- Ensure all necessary columns (radius, vpv, vsv, vph, vsh, rho) are present.
- Filter and compute derived columns like P-wave and S-wave velocities (P_v and S_v).
- Save the cleaned dataset for model training.

### Step 2: Model Training with Random Forest

**Function**: train_random_forest_model(data)
**Process**:
-Prepare the features and target variables (radius).
-Split the data into training and test sets.
-Train the Random Forest model.
-Perform Grid Search to find the optimal hyperparameters for better performance.
-Evaluate the model using mean absolute error (MAE) and percentage error.

### Step 3: Model Training with XGBoost

**Function**: train_xgboost_model(data)
**Process**:
-Similar to Random Forest, but with the XGBoost regressor for better performance in certain datasets.
-Perform Grid Search to tune hyperparameters for optimal results.
-Evaluate the model and print performance metrics.

**Step 4**: Evaluation and Comparison
**Function**: evaluate_models()
**Process**:
-Compare the results from both Random Forest and XGBoost using cross-validation and test dataset.
-Output the best-performing model based on MAE and percentage error.
