# Martian Core 3D Visualization with Seismic Wave Propagation

## Overview

This MATLAB project provides a 3D visualization of the Martian interior, illustrating the crust, mantle, and liquid core using a quarter-cutout for clarity. The simulation incorporates seismic wave propagation, demonstrating how P-waves (which pass through all layers) and S-waves (which stop at the mantle-core boundary) behave within Mars.

## Features

**3D Model of Mars' Interior**: Visual representation of the crust, mantle, and liquid core.
**Quarter-Cutout View**: Allows easy observation of internal layers.
**Seismic Wave Propagation Simulation**:

- P-Waves (Green): Travel through all layers, including the liquid core.
- S-Waves (Red): Stop at the mantle-core boundary as they cannot pass through liquid.

**Random Seismic Epicenter**: The waves originate from a random point above the mantle.
**Mars Surface Texture Mapping**: A realistic Martian surface texture is applied.

## Files

- martian_core_visualization.m - Generates the 3D model of the Martian interior.
- seismic_wave_propagation.m - Simulates seismic wave propagation.
- mars_texture.jpg - Texture map for the Martian surface.

## Installation and Usage

1. Ensure you have MATLAB installed.
2. Place all files (martian_core_visualization.m, seismic_wave_propagation.m, and mars_texture.jpg) in the same directory.
3. Run the core visualization script.-
4. Run the seismic wave propagation script.
